# Trading-Recommendations

Project Overview
This project utilizes a Transformer-based model to analyze high-frequency trading data and generate actionable trading recommendations. The focus is on the 'Close' price and selected technical indicators such as Stoch_k and MACD to drive trading strategies suited for high-frequency trading (HFT) environments.

Features
Data Analysis: Explore correlations and dynamics in trading data using Python and TensorFlow.
Model Implementation: Development and tuning of a Transformer model to predict market movements.
Trading Strategy: Generation of buy, sell, or hold signals based on model outputs.
